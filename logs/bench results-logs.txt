I am following the protocol (partly) by pmjones
https://github.com/pmjones/php-framework-benchmarks

Debian GNU/Linux 8.1 (jessie)
PHP 5.6.9-0+deb8u1 (cli) (built: Jun  5 2015 11:03:27)
 7:30 for the setup from scratch

here it fail because git ask you to create a personal token on their website.
You follow the link,
you copy/paste it & the composer install goes to the end.

LUMEN (without optimisitation)
Requests per second:    295.18 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    294.84 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    291.27 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    296.27 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    302.16 [#/sec] (mean)

LUMEN (with optimisitation)
Yes, composer seems actually slowing it down !
Requests per second:    268.00 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    263.43 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    265.45 [#/sec] (mean)
this is the selected empirical average value
don't question it, the test is wrong (because the client is in the same box)
;-)

Slim 3
Requests per second:    494.07 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    494.91 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    497.98 [#/sec] (mean)

So Slim 3 seems 60% to 70% faster
So seen a lot of variation during the tests
just tu cross check, let's do lumen again

LARAVEL (veeeery long)
Requests per second:    43.29 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    45.47 [#/sec] (mean)
(I am not patient enough to do several tests)
is there any difference if we "optimize"??
Requests per second:    44.75 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    42.22 [#/sec] (mean)

3 frameworks (badly) compared:
LUMEN   Requests per second:    242.29 [#/sec] (mean)
SLIM3   Requests per second:    485.59 [#/sec] (mean)
LARAVEL Requests per second:     43.29 [#/sec] (mean)
1 order of magnitude slim vs laravel
x2 slim3 vs lumen (slim 2 is faster than slim 3)
that's the conclusion of this part.

let's measure the bloat
Raw PHP

bench http://54.211.150.222/lumen/public/|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/slim3/api/fake/mickey|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/laravel/public/|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/raw|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/fatfree-composer-app-master/|grep "Requests per second"

Requests per second:    5179.26 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    5248.06 [#/sec] (mean)

This is "the cost of the bloat" ;-)
LUMEN 		Requests per second:    240.53 [#/sec] (mean)
SLIM3 		Requests per second:    497.75 [#/sec] (mean)
LARAVEL 5 	Requests per second:    47.27 [#/sec] (mean)
RAW PHP 	Requests per second:    5248.06 [#/sec] (mean)

# just to play, let's compare with fatfree
this is a fatfree project that uses composer (not mandatory with F3)
https://github.com/F3Community/fatfree-composer-app
FATFREE Composer  
Requests per second:    662.44 [#/sec] (mean)

FATFREE COMPOSER Requests per second:    655.92 [#/sec] (mean)

=========================================================
before they ask
let's fine tune opcache
my PC rebooted (f..g win8)

Before opcache opt
bench http://54.211.150.222/lumen/public/|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/slim3/api/fake/mickey|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/laravel/public/|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/raw|grep "Requests per second"
bench http://54.211.150.222/fatfree-composer-app-master/|grep "Requests per second"
Requests per second:    250.88 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    493.69 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    44.70 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    5179.38 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    651.75 [#/sec] (mean)

after opcache opt (worst!)
Requests per second:    215.47 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    365.61 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    1.69 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    424.66 [#/sec] (mean)
Requests per second:    418.82 [#/sec] (mean)
was it supposed to optimize? ;-)
